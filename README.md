## Background info

This docker image is based on Alpine Linux and **only contains the s1tbx toolbox**. Furthermore,

* the original installer provided by ESA ships its own oracle java
* Alpine is based on musl libc and busybox. As Oracle JAVA depends on glibc, it
  doesn't work smoothly. With https://github.com/sgerrand/alpine-pkg-glibc this
  can be workarounded to a certain way but in our case not sufficient (conflicting dependencies).
* From SNAP Version 8, oracle java > 8 and openjdk in general will be supported
  officially (https://forum.step.esa.int/t/problems-running-tests-in-intellij/9350/8)

## Where is the Ubuntu based docker image?

Find the Ubuntu based docker image related files in branch `ubuntu` (see [here](https://github.com/mundialis/esa-snap/tree/ubuntu)).

## Dev stuff

Alternatively, a build approch was tried out. Kept here if needed further.
As stable SNAP version 7.0.2 needs maven 3.6.0 (while alpine offers 3.6.3), so SNAP 8 was built for testing.

```

FROM alpine:edge

<!-- ARG SNAP_ENGINE_TAG=8.0.0 -->
ENV JAVA_HOME "/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk"

RUN apk add git openjdk8 maven

<!-- RUN git checkout $SNAP_ENGINE_TAG -->
RUN sed -i 's+<module>snap-classification</module>+<!--<module>snap-classification</module>-->+g' pom.xml
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests
